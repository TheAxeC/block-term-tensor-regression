# Block-Term Tensor Regression (BTTR)

BTTR is a deflation-based method in which the maximally correlated representations of :math:`\underline{\mathbf{X}}` and :math:`\mathbf{y}` are extracted via ACE/ACCoS at each iteration. Therefore, BTTR inherits the advantages of the proposed ACE/ACCoS and does not require one to set the model parameters manually. This provides BTTR with an additional important property: the ability to model complex data in which the optimal MTR is not necessarily stable across sequential decompositions.
